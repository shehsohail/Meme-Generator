This is our meme instructions sheet.  This doc will show you how to use our generator.

Couple quick notes:
SERIOUSLY, DO NOT MESS WITH THE FILE STRUCTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JPG and PNG are fully supported
GIFs will lose their animation and be saved as a single frame.  If the GIF file is not animated then the generator will meme the image properly.
You don't NEED Notepad.exe but it would be better if you did have it.
The origin (0,0) of the picture is in the top left corner with +x pointing right and +y pointing down.


Browse the Memes:
This button cycles through each meme that was made.  It will display jpgs, gifs (including animated gifs), and pngs.
Each click will display a different meme.
  Delete This Meme:
  If while browsing you see a meme you do not like click this button
  Clicking this button will delete the meme

Upload Your Own Meme Template:
Clicking this button will display a file browser.  Navigate to the directory where the meme is and open it.
The meme will be displayed to you and added to the templates folder.  You do not need to add it again unles you delete it.
Don't try and be funny by uploading a non supported image.  Only upload an image (gif, jpg, png)

Choose a Meme:
Similarly to Browse the Memes, this button one by one cycles through templates in the templates folder.
You use this to pick the template that you will be memeing.  
  Delete this Template:
  If while cycling through the templates you see a template you do not like then click this button
  Clicking this button will delete the meme template from the templates folder
